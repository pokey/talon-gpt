### Good ideas

- Use the fact it's an "intelligent" interlocutor so say things like "remember this" or "refer to this as X"
- Use "model and" to stitch things together, so "refer to this as X" then "model and simplify X"
- New destinations for diff and draft that show in vscode. Command to "submit" the diff
